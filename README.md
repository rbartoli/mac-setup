# Project
This project is a collection of my scripts to bootstrap a new OS X system

### Dependencies
1. Install [Xcode], if you don't have it yet.
2. Install [Xcode Command Line Tools], if you don't have it yet.
3. Open Xcode and accept the license agreement.

### Bootstrap new system
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/twig2let/setup/master/setup/bootstrap-new-system.sh | sh
```

This will run the additional install-brews.sh and configure-osx.sh scripts.
